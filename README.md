# Lizard - Best Buy Monitor
This is a program created to monitor items inside of the Best Buy website. 

## Overview
    A web app written in Node.js, using the Express framework and Mongoose ODM
    library with MongoDB on the backend, and the Angular framework on the frontend.

    I am new to Angular, and this is just a personal project to learn Angular and
    practice working on the backend. 

## Installation
```bash
npm install
```

## Run command
Navigate into the front end folder 'best-buy-frontend' and use the following command to run the frontend
```bash
ng serve
```

From the root directory use the following command to run the Express server for your backend
```bash
npm start
```

## Use
After starting, access the app on your localhost at port 4200
